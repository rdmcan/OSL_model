# OSL_model
Exploratory linear regression analysis on several data sets.

Firstly, through the scatter diagram, it is decided if this is a linear model; if the relationship is not linear, data transformation is applied. OLS model is applied to the original and transformed data. Finally, outliers are removed and the effect in the model (slope, intercept and R-square) is shown.
